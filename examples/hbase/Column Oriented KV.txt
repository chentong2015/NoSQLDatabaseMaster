HBase: Column Oriented key-value NoSQL database
HBase can store multiple values against one key into multiple columns.
HBase runs on top of Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).

内存操作低延迟，key键值查找短时间支持大量数据存储和变更
HBase groups data together to store new data in a “memory buffer”,
once the buffer is full, it dumps the data to the disk.
This way of storage not only helps store a lot of small data quickly,
but also “fetching rows by the key” or scanning ranges of rows.
